     <h3>ðŸŒŸ About Me:</h3>
     <p>A passionate Software Engineer student.
         I am passionate about creating new solutions to big problems. Finding an innovative, efficient, and maintainable solution to any type of problem is the reason I am in the world of technology. I am studying my degree at one of the three most important universities in my country: Universidad Nacional UNA.

It would be unrealistic and lacking humility to say that I am an expert in any area of life, so I am content to define myself as a passionate and disciplined lifelong learner!

I love data (perhaps that's why I tend to be a bit nosy in my personal life?), and this is the area where I feel most comfortable. The ability to manipulate data and optimize processes to improve the flow of information in a company or research project has driven me to dive deeper and continuously improve in this field; This passion led me to research and learn more about quantum programming (I am conducting a brief research on quantum programming. If you want to take a look, visit here: [IntroducciÃ³n a la computaciÃ³n cuantica](https://github.com/Kycoon04/quantum_computing)), which for now is just a hobby, but who knows if in the future I might collaborate on research and solutions to existing problems? For now, I try to improve my programming logic and algorithms with the help of my knowledge in mathematics.
